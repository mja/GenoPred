Welcome!

This website will provide details of a project evaluating methods for genotype-based prediction. The website will be updated continuously as the project develops.

#### Change log:

**24/06/2020**:

* Change log started
* Updated Ancestry_identifier.R to use proper grid search in enet, allow other modelling methods to be specified, and improve model performance reporting.

**13/08/2020**:

* Add comparison between standardised and non-standardised polygenic scores.

**10/02/2021**:

* PRS comparison: Added LDPred2 and DBSLMM methods. Added prostate and breast cancer. Add polygenicity and ancestry senstivity analysis.
* GeRS comparison: Minor formatting changes.
