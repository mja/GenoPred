Welcome!

This website will provide details of a project looking at the following aspects of genotype-based prediction:

* [Preparing reference files for genotype-based scoring](https://opain.github.io/GenoPred/Pipeline_prep.html)

* [Genotype-based scoring in target samples](https://opain.github.io/GenoPred/Genotype-based_scoring_in_target_samples.html)

* [Comparison of methods for calculating polygenic risk scores (PRSs)](https://opain.github.io/GenoPred/Determine_optimal_polygenic_scoring_approach.html)

* And more...

Please contact Oliver Pain (oliver.pain@kcl.ac.uk) to if you have any questions or comments.
