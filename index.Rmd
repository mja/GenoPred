Future alterations:

* Currently the pipeline uses 503 individuals (EUR super-population) within the 1000 Genomes reference to estimate European LD, MAF, and PCs. Some studies use only a subset of 378 individuals from the 1000 Genomes reference, which are EUR super-population excluding Finish individuals. Other studies have shown that using a larger sample to estimate LD can improve genotype-based prediction, with the SBayesR paper showing 50,000 random European indivduals from UKBB provides optimal prediction, with similar results from 5000. To address the limited reference data used in this project and optimise predictions, I will use 5,000 randonmly selected European individuals from UKBB.
