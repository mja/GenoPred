Welcome!

This website will provide details of a project evaluating methods for genotype-based prediction.

***

#### Contents:

* Data preparation
  * Genetic
    * [Reference genetic: European 503 subset of 1KG](https://opain.github.io/GenoPred/Pipeline_prep.html)
    * [Reference genetic: European 10K subset of UK Biobank](https://opain.github.io/GenoPred/Pipeline_prep_withUKBB_ref.html)
    * [Target genetic](https://opain.github.io/GenoPred/Genotype-based_scoring_in_target_samples.html)
  * Phenotypic
    * [Target phenotypic](https://opain.github.io/GenoPred/Target_sample_phenotype_prep.html)
    
* Statistical analysis
  * [Comparison of polygenic scoring methods](https://opain.github.io/GenoPred/Determine_optimal_polygenic_scoring_approach.html)

* Future developments
  * Evaluation of ancestry information for prediction
  * Comparison between polygenic scoring and imputed gene-expression scoring
  * Stratification using pathway/tissue-specific genetic scores
  * Genetic prediction visualisation tools
  * Ancestry sensitive genetic prediction framework
  * Transferability of European GWAS to non-European populations
