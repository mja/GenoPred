Welcome!

This website will provide details of a project looking at the following aspects of genotype-based prediction:
* [Preparing reference files for genotype-based scoring](https://opain.github.io/GenoPred/Pipeline_prep.html)
* [Calculating reference-standardised genotype-based scores in UK Biobank](https://opain.github.io/GenoPred/Geno_scoring_in_UKBB.html)
* [Code to compare predictive utility of genotype-based scores](https://opain.github.io/GenoPred/Model_builder_instructions.html)
* [Comparison of methods for calculating polygenic risk scores (PRSs)](https://opain.github.io/GenoPred/Determine_optimal_polygenic_scoring_approach.html)

* And more...
